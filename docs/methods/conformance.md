# Conformance evidence

[Overview](../../README.md) · [Methods and reproduction](../../README.md#documentation)

The held-out suite includes explicit source-labelled minor interaction evidence
(`CriticalResults.followThrough`, `Core.Alerts.keys`): a current-medication class
alone does not establish a minor interaction.
The fixture selects class-interaction evidence for frozen specs using
`V1.minorInteractionPopupAlert` (`cond = interaction`) and minor-only evidence
for the successor. `Core.Alerts.keys` suppresses minor alerts under severe
interaction evidence. Both contracts retain the same firing and completion
assertions, without rewriting frozen rules or changing scenario applicability;
native unit fixtures exercise both conditions. Native tests default to the
checkout's built `ehr` before the optional cached binary.

The critical-result case checks
available/unresolved urgency, non-resolution by UI acknowledgment or inbox
signing, and the separate receive/document/resolve path. Immutable recorded
specifications predating that alert are explicitly inapplicable; current rules
still require the case. Optional service prior-auth cases require a surfaced
service control; a partially missing surface remains a failure. Declared-link
cases revisit through real navigation when source and destination share a screen,
so screen-entry prefills are tested without injecting captures. Target metadata
distinguishes frozen specification evidence from historical release-name aliases.
The shared `chart`
scope is part of every persona's workflow contract. The CURES-removal audit is
bound to the current program/spec/binary and must fail `completable` when neither
the report nor a reachable waiver is available; stored checker evidence never
supplies behavioral expectations. Saved reports retain source-digested refresh
provenance for the complete critical-result path and version-bound nursing
fixture, alongside the independently rerun full-suite evidence.
