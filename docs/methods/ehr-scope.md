# What parts of a real EHR are replicated

[Overview](../../README.md) · [Methods and reproduction](../../README.md#documentation)

The app models the clinician-facing workflows of a hospital and clinic EHR on
FHIR data. It is a research system on synthetic patients, not a deployable
product.

| Area | Replicated | Not replicated or simplified |
|---|---|---|
| **Workflows** | Seven end-to-end workflows: W1 adult clinic visit (rooming → history → exam → orders → sign → close), W2 results inbox and patient messages, W3 emergency department (track board, triage, orders, disposition), W4 inpatient nursing (worklist, MAR, flowsheets, SBAR handoff), W5 pediatric visit (growth charts, vaccines), W6 surgery (consult, pre-op, operative note, post-op orders, OR schedule), W7 refill requests. | Pharmacy verification and dispensing, lab and radiology departments, scheduling engine, registration, billing and claims, patient portal. |
| **Roles** | Physician, nurse practitioner, RN, surgeon; charge nurse, bed manager and admitting clerk for bed management. Five personas: primary care, ED, inpatient RN, pediatric NP, surgeon. | Pharmacists, technicians, residents with supervision chains, schedulers. |
| **Chart** | Patient banner (name, DOB, MRN, allergies, code status, isolation, weight), patient sidebar, chart history tabs (encounters, notes, results, meds, problems, allergies, imaging), lab trends and flowsheets, WHO/CDC growth curves, chart search. | Imaging viewer (PACS), scanned media, outside-records exchange. |
| **Orders** | Medication order composer with order favorites, formulary dose units, kg dosing weight, route, frequency, PRN, dispense and refills, pharmacy, indication and diagnosis; lab, imaging and procedure orders; prior authorization (release v2); coded antibiotic indication (release v3). | Real e-prescribing transmission, pharmacy interventions. |
| **Safety checks** | Hard-stop sign guards; drug-allergy, interaction, duplicate-therapy, dose-range and high-alert alerts, interruptive (modal) or passive (inline); barcode patient and medication scan at administration; second-nurse cosign for high-alert drugs; patient-ID re-entry; review receipts that expire; critical-result escalation; California controlled-substance rules (CURES check, naloxone offer, Schedule II refills). | Real CURES/PDMP queries, barcode hardware, a full drug-knowledge base (a small formulary is built in). |
| **Documentation** | Visit and operative notes, nursing assessments, vaccine administration, consent, SBAR handoff, administration records. | Note templates, dictation. |
| **Bed management (ADT)** | Admit, assign, transfer, atomic bed swap, linked admission/transfer/discharge cancellation, release, discharge and bed cleaning on a unit bed board. | Enterprise patient flow, transport authority, reservations, multiple facilities. |
| **Regulatory updates** | Vendor releases v1 → v2 → v3 that add rules, migrated per clinician and re-certified. | Real vendor upgrade tooling. |
| **Data and storage** | Immutable FHIR R4 imports and Postgres event projections: Patient, Encounter, Observation, Condition, AllergyIntolerance, MedicationRequest, MedicationAdministration, Immunization, DiagnosticReport, DocumentReference, ServiceRequest, Procedure, Consent, Appointment, Task, Communication, ChargeItem, Provenance. Native-guarded, versioned commands and live updates for all workflows. | HL7v2 interfaces, enterprise patient index, production audit logging, high availability. |
| **Identity** | Keycloak single sign-on (PKCE) for all live clinical, MAR and bed-management workflows. | Production identity, break-the-glass access. |
| **Users** | Simulated clinicians with seeded behavior and interruptions, measured in clicks, scrolls and mouse travel. The default policy plans through the current screens; an optional bounded policy learns locations and searches visible controls. | Real clinicians; no user study. Search, practice, forgetting and hidden tastes use uncalibrated simulation assumptions. |
